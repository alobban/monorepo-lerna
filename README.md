# monorepo-lerna
Testing monorepo pattern with Lerna

### Setup
Clone repo then install yarn workspace.  
`yarn` has to be installed
```
npm i -g yarn
```

From the root of the monorepo, run `yarn install`.

### Execute
I haven't create a single point of entry as yet; therefore, you'll need to start each CRA 
app individually from their respective folders.
